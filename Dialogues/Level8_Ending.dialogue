Lyra: Thank you for leading me to this magical place! I can feel that our journey is about to come to an end.
Lyra: See how far we got? I knew we could make it! 
Lyra: Without you I would have been trapped forever in that icy prison!
Lyra: No matter how many times you failed, you tried again... and again.
Lyra: Regardless of the challenges that came your way, you prevailed.
Lyra: I'm really proud of you, little penguin! Now you are ready for the final step!
