~ Level2_Intro
Lyra: Ohh thanks! Finally someone freed me from this icy prison! I'm Lyra, the wishing star.
Lyra: I'm so far away from home! It appears you also lost your way. Let's travel together!
Lyra: Hmmm, did you attempt to fly, like a [i]real[/i] bird?
Lyra: Seems like that did not properly work out!
Lyra: So, listen. We can't turn back the clock, but no need for melancholy. I will fulfil your heart's desire and grant you the power of "flying".
Lyra: Don't just stand here, go give it a shot! Now you can finally start your journey!
